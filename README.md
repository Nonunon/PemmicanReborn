## Pemmican out of anything (Food-like)!

`But on Github :D`

In the vanilla game, crafting pemmican requires equal parts meat and vegetables. This mod removes that restriction, allowing you to use strictly vegetables, strictly meat, or any combination thereof when preparing pemmican through the bill menu.

_This change reflects the diverse ways pemmican has been prepared historically, offering more flexibility in your colony's food production._

**Cultural Note**: Pemmican is a traditional food created by Indigenous peoples of North America. Traditionally made with dried meat and fat, variations have included different ingredients based on availability.

For those interested in vegetarian alternatives, [**here is a source on vegetarian-like pemmican**](https://www.nrcnaa.org/pdf/cookbook.pdf), where animal fats can be replaced with plant-based options like nut butters or olive oil.

Creating a meat-based pemmican remains true to its origins, and adding ingredients like berries and roots is a common practice.
